# Checkpoint-Core 2024 Spring Retrospective

## Skills

Although much of what we learned this semester is difficult to quantify, our team gained important skills and experience with many industry standard technologies, as well as strategies for gaining familiarity with unfamiliar software and/or APIs. These skills include the following:

- Docker
- FastAPI API framework (similar to Django)
- ORM technology (SQLAlchemy)
- SQL databases (Postgres)
- Project management
- Requirements gathering
- Identifying project scope

## Lessons

Our team learned valuable lessons about time management, teamwork, and communication. We held regular meetings to identify the week's goals and priorities, and to delegate the work appropriately. We also had a unique opportunity to work closely with another team on interdependent projects, which gave us insight into communicating with outside teams and freely sharing priorities and requirements. We also gained experience in regularly, concisely, and effectively communicating the logic and behavior of our project to other team members unfamiliar with it.

## TODO

While we were able to complete most of the requirements we set out to accomplish at the start of the semester, there were some features that were out of scope for a single semester project. Among the features were were able to implement:
    i. Admin users ("admins") can add, remove, and manage equipment in a catalog
    ii.  Non-admin users can browse the catalog and request to borrow available equipment
    iii.  The system tracks borrowed items and updates item availability
    iv.  Notifications keep users informed about due dates and overdue items
In addition, we were able to implement the following:
    v. Admins are also notified upon check out/check in
    vi. Admins can log damage to items
A few features we weren't able to implement include:
    vii. Reserve equipment in advance for a future date
    viii. Store quantity and track how many are available or reserved
    ix. block certain equipment reservations pending admin approval, for especially valuable equipment
    x. implement "super admin" to ensure at least 1 admin remains in the system at any given time
