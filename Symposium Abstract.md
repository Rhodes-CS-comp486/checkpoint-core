# Checkpoint Core

Checkpoint Core is the database and application logic backend of the Checkpoint equipment check-out web service. It provides secure storage and hosting for essential equipment and user data to allow seamless check-out and check-in for equipment held by the computer science department for use by students and faculty, such as robotics equipment and computers. Via requests from Checkpoint Core's counterpart Checkpoint Web, equipment can be reserved for pick-up and assigned to individuals. Administrator users can retrieve and store equipment status such as current user assignment and degree of wear-and-tear for the purpose of equipment refresh and replacement, to ensure the Rhodes community has access to the best available materials. Checkpoint Core, alongside its counterpart, Checkpoint Web, allows the Computer Science department faculty to more easily manage, maintain, and update its cache of equipment. Checkpoint Core runs as a containerized microservice that was built using Python, the FastAPI framework, and Docker. It is hosted using the uvicorn web server and uses a PostgreSQL database.
