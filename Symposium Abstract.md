# Checkpoint Core

Checkpoint is the database backend of the Checkpoint equipment check-out web service. It provides secure storage and hosting for essential equipment and user data to allow seamless check-out and check-in for equipment held by the computer science department for use by students and faculty, such as robotics equipment and computers. Users can easily reserve equipment for pick-up and view all equipment for which they are responsible, and admin users can verify equipment status such as wear-and-tear for the purpose of equipment refresh and replacement, to ensure the Rhodes community has access to the best available materials. Checkpoint Core, alongside its counterpart, Checkpoint Web, allows the Computer Science department faculty to more easily manage, maintain, and update its cache of state-of-the-art equipment.
