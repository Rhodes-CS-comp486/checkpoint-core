Combined Grade: 94

## Planning Document Feedback (Group): 

- Your system description is good. It summarizes what the system does well. It should be a good starting point for your Rhodes Symposium abstract.
- Your architectural overview is a good start, but needs a little bit of work. I'm not sure what is meant by data management protocol. I think you can just change that to 'people and equipment database'. You really should include the notification system (remove the question mark). You also need to make it very clear that 'Web App' is not part of the system you are developing, but one possible consumer of your API.
- Your epics are great. Only suggestion is that 'Login Protocol' might need to be more of a 'User/Account' epic. You probably need an 'Equipment' epic too.
- Your non-functional requirements are good.
- Your technologies and frameworks section is a good start. I like that you included alternate possibilities for your database technologies.
- Your MVP looks good.
- Your roadmap looks reasonable. It would have been nice if you had explicitly indicated which sprint your MVP would be completed in.

## Requirements Feedback (Group): 

- Your user stories are generally very good. A few suggestions: (1) try to avoid technical details. for example, users want to borrow equipment. they don't care about the existence of an API. (2) Be careful using something like 'backend system' as the user in your user stories (see US3). It would be better stated in terms of the borrower's needs. 'As a borrower of equipment, I want the availability status of equipment to be updated when someone borrows/returns equipment, so that I know which equipment is available for me to borrow.'
- Your titles are consistently formatted and generally easy to understand.
- All of your user stories are traceable to epics, which is great.
- You have defined acceptance criteria for all of your user stories. In most cases, your ACs are very good. In just a few cases, your ACs are more like tasks (e.g., see US7).
- You have estimates of level of effort on all of your user stories, which is great; however, there are a few inconsistencies. Why is US8 'Low Effort', but US9 is 'High Effort'. Aren't both similar notiications? (That said, I may not understand all the details.)
- Your prioritization looks consistent with your roadmap.
- Overall great job!
